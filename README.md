# password-list-generator
educational randomized password generator that outputs 20k passwords to a text file
it generates typical "secure" passwords that are 8 to 12 characters long and contain
upper and lower case letters, numbers, and puncutiation. 

Passwords generated are NOT for actual use as passwords and should NOT be considdered secure. 
This is for CTFs and eduction about "secure passwords". 
I do this for fun; it's not a full featured program.

Current version:
Uses, multi proceesing to slightly speed up some of my inefficent code.
Added new features so the 20k approx passwords will be output to a file.
This started as an exercise to learn string methods and now is an excersie in making it go fast.
Spoolier Alert: it's not that fast. 

Please see V2 which is much better.
